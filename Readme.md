# Module Watcher üîé

Module Watcher makes sure that you won't miss any update from your third-party modules 
installed on the Magento2-based projects.

The project is on MVP stage and has a lot of var_dumps() üòÑ

## Requirements

- PHP 7.2
- Cron/CI system
- Git
- php mail()/Swift Mail/Slack

## Workflow

### 1. Add a new project to the config file

Module Watcher has a common config files (possible to have a couple of them) 
that helps to declare and share watcher configurations. Example of the config file can be found
under `module-watcher.yaml.sample`.

### 2. Install your project

Module Watcher uses Git to access your project branch you want to track dependencies on.
Before watching you need to run `project:install-projects` command to make sure all projects and their configs are
installed and ready to be watched.

It's good to run this command after adding a new project, changing actual branch or changing list of branches.

### 3. Watch Your Modules

After your config file is installed, you are ready to run `project:watch` command and 
get notifications about module updates.

It's convenient to run the command from Cron or CLI to constantly get notifications and don't forget about this action.

The command makes project branches up to date and then performs checks for
Magento2 modules installed in all possible ways.

- ‚úÖ Third-party modules installed via Composer from Vendor Packagists
